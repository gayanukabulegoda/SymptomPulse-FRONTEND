## Security Practices

We are committed to ensuring that SymptomPulse FRONTEND is secure and reliable. Key security measures include:

- **Secure Storage & Handling**: Sensitive information such as JWT tokens and API endpoints is managed using industry best practices. No sensitive data is stored directly in the repository.
- **Code Reviews**: All code contributions undergo rigorous reviews, with a focus on identifying and mitigating potential security risks.
- **Dependency Management**: We regularly audit third-party libraries and dependencies to ensure they are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities.
- **Configuration Security**: API connection details are managed in a dedicated configuration file (`config.ts`), ensuring that credentials and other sensitive data are not exposed.

## Handling Security Issues

- **Timely Resolution**: Once a security issue is confirmed, we will prioritize its resolution. Patches or updates will be released as quickly as possible.
- **Responsible Disclosure**: We follow responsible disclosure practices. Details of any vulnerability will be published only after a fix has been merged.
